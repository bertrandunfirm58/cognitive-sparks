# Sparks

**13 cognitive primitives that teach AI to think — not just compute.**

> Give it a goal and data. It observes, abstracts, analogizes, plays, and synthesizes — like a Renaissance polymath.

Based on [Sparks of Genius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparks_of_Genius) (Root-Bernstein, 1999) — the 13 thinking tools used by Einstein, Picasso, da Vinci, Feynman, and Nabokov.

---

## What is this?

Every AI agent framework teaches agents **what to do** (call tools, manage state).
Sparks teaches agents **how to think** (observe, abstract, analogize, synthesize).

```
Input:  Goal + Data (any format)
Output: Core Principles + Evidence + Confidence + Analogies
```

### The 3-Layer Architecture

+=========================================================+
|  LAYER 0: NEURAL CIRCUIT                                 |
|  ~30 neural populations, ~80+ learned connections        |
|  Rate-coded LIF neurons + STDP + neuromodulation         |

|  No fixed order. Tool execution ORDER EMERGES            |

### How It's Different

```
Orchestra (LangGraph/CrewAI):     Conductor commands -> musicians play in order
Harness (Claude Code):            Case protects instrument + stage manages logistics
Nervous System (Sparks):          No conductor. No fixed order.
                                  Tool execution emerges from neural dynamics.
                                  Connection weights learned through STDP.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PROVE1352/cognitive-sparks.git
cd cognitive-sparks
pip install -e .

# Analyze data (autonomic cascade — circuit decides tool order)
sparks run --goal "Find the core principles" --data ./my-data/ --depth standard

# Full loop: validate -> evolve -> predict -> feedback
sparks loop --principles output/results.md --data ./new-data/ --cycles 3

# Ablation: disable nervous system (sequential pipeline)
sparks run --goal "..." --data ./my-data/ --no-nervous
```

### Depth Modes

| Mode | Tools | Execution | Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| `quick` | 4 core | 1 cascade | ~$0.15 |
| `standard` | 7 tools | cascade + consolidation + re-cascade | ~$2-6 |
| `deep` | **13 tools** | full cascade + consolidation | ~$5-15 |

### Emergent Tool Ordering (no hardcoded sequence)

The pipeline `observe -> patterns -> abstract -> synthesize` is NOT coded. It **emerges** from neural dynamics:

| State | Winner | Activation | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Empty (no data) | **observe** | 0.59 | `obs_hunger=1.0` drives observe neuron |
| 20 observations | **recognize_patterns** | 0.52 | `obs_count` rises, patterns hungry |
| + 8 patterns | **abstract** | 0.55 | `pat_count` rises, principles hungry |
| + 4 principles | **analogize** | 0.43 | principles drive analogy neuron |
| + analogies | **synthesize** | 0.41 | all inputs ready, integrate mode |

This sequence is learned via STDP and evolves across sessions.

### Phase B-E: Full Loop (`sparks loop`)

```
B: VALIDATE   Principles + New Data -> support/contradict per principle
      |
      v
C: EVOLVE     Low score -> refine/drop, high score -> keep
      |        New patterns found -> add principles
      v
D: PREDICT    Validated principles + new situation -> testable predictions
      |        (falsifiable, time-bound)
      v
E: FEEDBACK   Predictions vs outcomes -> strengthen/weaken/refine/drop
      |        Dopamine signal updates principle confidence
      |
      +------> Back to B (--cycles N)

Principles persist at ~/.sparks/loop/ and evolve across sessions.
```

### Phase F: Self-Optimization (`sparks optimize`)

```
1. DIAGNOSE      Analyze output.md -> per-tool quality score (0-1)
      |          "model 0%, analogize 15%, synthesize 78%"
      v
2. GENERATE      Surgical prompt fixes + circuit weight tuning
      |
      v
3. PLAY-VALIDATE Stress-test each fix BEFORE applying:
      |          - INVERT: would the opposite change be better?
      |          - REMOVE: would STDP self-correct without this fix?
      |          - EXAGGERATE: push fix 10x — what breaks?
      |          - SIDE EFFECTS: unintended changes?
      |          -> safe / risky / reject per fix
      v
4. APPLY         Only safe fixes applied (with backup)

Previous output -> optimize -> better prompts/weights -> better output -> ...
```

### Cross-Session Learning

```
Session 1:  Initial circuit weights -> run -> STDP learning -> save weights
Session 2:  Load weights -> successful tool chains fire faster
Session N:  Framework specializes to your domain
            Market data: observe->patterns->abstract chain strengthened
            Code analysis: observe->shift_dimension->model chain strengthened
```

## The Neural Circuit

Not if-else rules pretending to be neurons. Actual neural dynamics.

### Neuron Model: Rate-coded Leaky Integrate-and-Fire

```
tau * dr/dt = -(r - baseline) + I_total * gain + noise
if r > threshold: fire, enter refractory period
```

### Architecture

| Layer | Populations | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Sensory | 11 (obs_count, pat_count, hunger signals, etc.) | Encode state as neural input |
| Signal | 5 (convergence, contradiction, diminishing, anomaly, sufficient) | Integrate evidence |
| Tool | 13 (one per thinking tool) | Activation -> tool fires |
| Mode | 2 (explore / integrate, mutual inhibition) | Global behavioral mode |

### Learning

| Mechanism | Biology | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **STDP** | Spike-timing dependent plasticity | Co-firing tools strengthen connections; timing matters |
| **Reward modulation** | Dopamine gates plasticity | Tool success/failure modulates STDP via dopamine signal |
| **Homeostatic plasticity** | Neurons maintain target firing rate | Over-active populations shrink incoming weights |
| **Neuromodulation** | DA/NE/ACh adjust gain globally | Dopamine (reward), NE (arousal), ACh (learning rate) |
| **Hunger signals** | Absence = signal (like hunger) | Missing data types drive relevant tools (obs_hunger -> observe) |
| **Persistence** | Long-term memory | Weights + baselines saved to JSON, evolve across sessions |

### Emergent Behavior (no rules, just weights)

Tested with empty -> populated state transitions:

| State | Highest tool | Activation | Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Empty (no data) | **observe** | 0.59 | balanced |
| 20 observations | **recognize_patterns** | 0.52 | balanced |
| + 8 patterns | **abstract** | 0.55 | balanced |
| + 4 principles | **analogize** | 0.43 | parasympathetic |

The pipeline `observe -> patterns -> abstract -> analogize -> synthesize` emerges from dynamics alone.

## The 13 Thinking Tools

| # | Tool | Inspiration | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **observe** | Observation with focused lens | Extract observations through domain-specific channels |
| 2 | **imagine** | Mental simulation | "What if X at 10x? What if opposite?" |
| 3 | **abstract** | Picasso Bull reduction | Progressively strip non-essential until essence remains |
| 4 | **recognize_patterns** | Pattern recognition | Find recurring, absent, interference patterns |
| 5 | **form_patterns** | Pattern composition | Combine patterns -> emergence (moire effect) |
| 6 | **analogize** | Structural analogy | Find deep structural correspondence across domains |
| 7 | **body_think** | Body thinking | Feel the data: weight, texture, rhythm, tension |
| 8 | **empathize** | Empathy | Become the actors inside the data |
| 9 | **shift_dimension** | Dimensional thinking | Same data, different axis: time, scale, frequency |
| 10 | **model** | Cardboard model | Build rough model, see what breaks |
| 11 | **play** | Systematic rule-breaking | Remove/invert/exaggerate principles |
| 12 | **transform** | Representation change | Narrative->equation, static->dynamic |
| 13 | **synthesize** | Simultaneous integration | All tools resonate at once |

---

## Full Loop (Phase B-F)

Phase A (above) extracts principles. The full loop validates and evolves them:

```
Phase A: Raw Data -> 13 Tools -> Principles (sparks run)
Phase B: Principles + New Data -> Validation scores
Phase C: Weak principles refined/dropped, strong ones kept
Phase D: Validated principles -> Predictions (sparks loop --predict)
Phase E: Predictions vs outcomes -> Feedback (sparks loop --outcomes)
Phase F: Auto-cycle B->E on each new data batch
```

```bash
# Validate + evolve principles against new data
sparks loop -p output/results.md -d ./new-data/ --cycles 3

# Generate predictions
sparks loop -p output/results.md --predict "Next week: Fed meeting + tariff deadline"

# Feedback: compare predictions to reality
sparks loop -p output/results.md --predict "..." --outcomes "What actually happened: ..."
```

Principles are persistent (`~/.sparks/loop/`) and evolve across sessions.

---

## Validation: A-Test

Fed Sparks 15 months of market observation data (640K chars) to test if it independently discovers the same core laws that human experts extracted manually over months.

| Mode | Principles | Avg Confidence | Coverage | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| standard (7 tools) | 7 | 80% | 68% | $6.06 |
| **deep (13 tools)** | **12** | **91%** | **85%** | **$9.02** |

The deep analysis found 12 principles. The top 3 structurally matched manually-extracted laws, plus 9 additional principles the manual analysis hadn't formalized. The 6 new tools (imagine, body_think, empathize, shift_dimension, play, transform) contributed 5 of those additional principles.

## Backends

Set `SPARKS_BACKEND` to choose your LLM provider:

| Backend | Provider | Setup | Structured Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cli` (default) | Claude Code CLI | Free with subscription | JSON-in-prompt |
| `anthropic` | Anthropic API | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Native tool_use |
| `openai` | OpenAI API | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Native json_schema |
| `google` | Google Gemini | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | JSON-in-prompt |
| `openai-compat` | Any OpenAI-compatible | `SPARKS_COMPAT_BASE_URL` | JSON-in-prompt |

```bash
# Claude Code CLI (default, free with subscription)
sparks run --goal "..." --data ./path/

# OpenAI
SPARKS_BACKEND=openai OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... sparks run --goal "..." --data ./path/

# Google Gemini
SPARKS_BACKEND=google GOOGLE_API_KEY=... sparks run --goal "..." --data ./path/

# Ollama (local)
SPARKS_BACKEND=openai-compat SPARKS_COMPAT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1 sparks run ...

# Groq
SPARKS_BACKEND=openai-compat SPARKS_COMPAT_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1 \
  SPARKS_COMPAT_API_KEY=gsk-... sparks run ...
```

Model names auto-map between providers. `claude-sonnet` becomes `gpt-4o-mini` on OpenAI, `gemini-2.5-flash` on Google. Native model names (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `gemini-2.5-pro`) also work directly.

Install provider-specific dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e ".[openai]"    # OpenAI
pip install -e ".[google]"    # Gemini
pip install -e ".[all]"       # All providers
```

## Theoretical Foundation

> "Phenomena are complex. Laws are simple. Find out what to discard." — Feynman

The 13 thinking tools are the atomic operations of creative thought — used identically by scientists, artists, and engineers across all domains. If these operations are truly universal, applying them systematically to any dataset should extract the same depth of understanding that human experts achieve through years of experience.

### What makes this different
- **LangGraph/CrewAI**: "How to orchestrate tools" -> We: "How to think with tools"
- **AutoGPT/autoresearch**: "Faster experiments" -> We: "Deeper understanding"
- **GPT-Researcher/STORM**: "Better search" -> We: "Better abstraction"
- **Brain-inspired AI**: Mimics neurons for computation -> We: Mimics nervous system for orchestration

### Sparks가 뭔가요?

모든 AI 에이전트 프레임워크는 **무엇을 할지**(도구 호출, 상태 관리)를 가르칩니다.
Sparks는 **어떻게 생각할지**(관찰, 추상화, 유추, 통합)를 가르칩니다.

"생각의 탄생"(Root-Bernstein, 1999) 책에서 아인슈타인, 피카소, 다빈치, 파인만이 공통으로 사용한 **13가지 사고 도구**를 AI 프리미티브로 구현했습니다.

### 핵심 차별점

```
LangGraph/CrewAI:  지휘자가 연주자에게 순서대로 명령
Sparks:            지휘자 없음. 신경 회로의 연결 가중치에서 실행 순서가 자연 발생
```

- **신경 회로**: ~30개 뉴런 집단이 가중치를 통해 신호 전파. if-else 규칙이 아닌 동역학에서 행동이 창발
- **STDP 학습**: 도구가 성공하면 도파민 신호 → 해당 연결 강화. 세션마다 회로가 진화
- **13도구 전체 구현**: 관찰, 형상화, 추상화, 패턴인식, 패턴형성, 유추, 몸으로생각하기, 감정이입, 차원적사고, 모형, 놀이, 변형, 통합
- **풀 루프**: 원리 추출 → 검증 → 진화 → 예측 → 피드백 → 반복
- **멀티모델**: Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Ollama, Groq 지원

### 검증 결과 (A-Test)

15개월치 시장 관찰 데이터를 넣고 "핵심 법칙을 찾아라"고 했더니, 사람이 수개월에 걸쳐 수동으로 추출한 3가지 핵심 법칙을 **독립적으로 재발견** + 추가 9개 원리를 찾아냈습니다.

| 모드 | 원리 | 평균 신뢰도 | 커버리지 | 비용 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| standard (7도구) | 7개 | 80% | 68% | $6.06 |
| **deep (13도구)** | **12개** | **91%** | **85%** | **$9.02** |

### 사용법

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PROVE1352/cognitive-sparks.git
cd cognitive-sparks
pip install -e .

# 데이터 분석 (자율 신경계 모드)
sparks run --goal "핵심 원리를 찾아라" --data ./데이터/ --depth deep

# 원리 검증 + 진화
